# Author name : Harshal Bhave
This was a project built by me and my college friends Chirag @chiragvispute and Varun 
The program is a game inspired by the famous online game Akinator but we have built the Indian premier league-IPL version of it
The program is written in C and is completely hard coded. </br>
We used data structures and runtime memory allocation malloc in the program. </br>

>> How to play? -- You have to think of any player of the IPL , and answer the questions asked by the 'Akinator'
                correctly , through which the game would try to guess the player you were thinking of.
Please Note : the data in the game is of IPL 2023, so select the player featured in IPL 2023 and asnwer the questions accordingly.
